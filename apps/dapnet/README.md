# DAPNET plugin

DAPNET/POCSAG amateur-radio paging via a serial-connected companion board
(`pocsag_companion/`, an ESP32 + SX1276/SX1262 sketch — TTGO LoRa32 or
Heltec V3). Bidirectional: it both decodes real DAPNET pages (capcode,
function, text) and, from its own on-device WiFi dashboard or this
plugin's Send tab, transmits alpha pages with a licensed operator
callsign prefix.

Unlike every RTL-SDR plugin (ACARS, RTL433, Radio, ...), this one isn't
listener-shaped at all — it's the reference for the `"capture"`/`"protocol"`
plugin seams (see `docs/PLUGINS.md`): a real `CaptureSource` joins the
core packet pipeline directly, unconditionally at boot, and it owns
decode + classification for its own protocol identity
(`OpenProtocol("dapnet")`, not a member of the closed core `Protocol`
enum). It's also the reference for `"topbar"` — its own persistent
status chip next to the built-in Meshtastic/MeshCore/Pager chips
(`window.registerTopbarChip`). It ships `locked = true` in its
`plugin.toml`, so unlike a plugin you drop in yourself it won't offer a
Delete button on Settings → Plugins (it's git-tracked, so deleting it
wouldn't stick past the next `Update` anyway).

## Install

1. Run setup once (checks for the shared `arduino-cli`/ESP32 toolchain
   `scripts/install.sh` already sets up — needed only for the
   Configuration → Firmware compile/flash card below, nothing else to
   build for capture/decode itself):

   ```sh
   sudo bash /opt/meshpoint/plugins/apps/dapnet/setup.sh
   # or, for a confirmation prompt first:
   sudo meshpoint plugin setup dapnet
   ```

2. Enable it and configure at least one companion device in `local.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     dapnet:
       enabled: true
       devices:
         - serial_port: "/dev/ttyUSB2"
           serial_baud: 115200
           label: "ttgo"
           name: "Attic POCSAG"
   ```

3. Restart Meshpoint. Decoded traffic shows up on **Networks → DAPNET**.

## Configuration

Everything lives under `plugins.dapnet` — device connection info and
capcode filters, previously two separate core config sections, are now
one opaque shape like every other plugin's:

```yaml
plugins:
  dapnet:
    enabled: true
    status_poll_interval_s: 60                 # 10-3600, default 60
    blacklist_capcodes: [200, 208, 216, 224]   # shown live, never stored
    ignore_capcodes: [4512, 4520]              # neither shown nor stored
    devices:
      - serial_port: "/dev/ttyUSB2"
        serial_baud: 115200
        label: "ttgo"
        name: "Attic POCSAG"
```

`devices`/`status_poll_interval_s` changes need a service restart
(`DapnetSerialSource` reads both once, at construction); the two
capcode-filter lists take effect immediately, and saving either also
purges any already-stored pages for a newly-added capcode. All of it is
also editable from the DAPNET page's own **Settings** tab, which is the
same PUT under the hood (`GET`/`PUT /api/dapnet/settings`).

## Topbar chip + status card

Both exist side by side, same as Meshtastic/MeshCore having both a
compact topbar chip and a detailed page: a **topbar chip**
(`dapnet_topbar_chip.js`, callsign/frequency/board, next to the built-in
Meshtastic/MeshCore/Pager chips) and a **status card** at the top of the
DAPNET page itself (more detail — hostname, WiFi SSID, TX count,
uptime). Both poll the same `GET /api/dapnet/status`. The topbar chip
briefly went away during the plugin extraction (no generic "plugin owns
a topbar chip" seam existed yet); it's back now via a real one
(`window.registerTopbarChip`, `docs/PLUGINS.md`'s [Adding a topbar
chip](../../../docs/PLUGINS.md#adding-a-topbar-chip-topbar)) that any
other plugin can use too.
